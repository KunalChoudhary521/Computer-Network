%The following code will generate Plot 1; You generate Plot2 , Plot3.
%Hint1: For Plot2 and Plot3, you only need to change 'initial_p', the
%       initial time in microseconds, and 'ag_frame', the time period of
%       aggregation
%Hint2: After adding Plot2 and Plot3 to this part, you can use 'subplot(3,1,2);'
%       and 'subplot(3,1,3);' respectively to show 3 plots in the same figure.
